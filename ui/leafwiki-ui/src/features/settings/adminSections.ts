// Barrel for the admin-only settings sections (roles: ['admin']).
// Re-exported from one module so their `lazy()` imports in lazy-routes.tsx
// share a single dynamic-import specifier and land in one chunk instead of
// six — see the plan in pleaf/root/AI-Gen-Infos/plans/open/features/
// settings-admin-sections-shared-chunk.md. Account stays out of this barrel
// since it's visible to non-admin users too.
